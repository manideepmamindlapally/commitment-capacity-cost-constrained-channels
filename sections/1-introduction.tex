\subsection{Notations}
\label{sec:notations}

We denote random variables by upper case letters (eg. $X$), the values they take by lower case letters (eg., $x$), and their alphabets by calligraphic letters (eg. $\cX$). 
\\
Unless stated otherwise, all sets are assumed to be finite. 
\\
We denote random vectors and the concomitant values they take by boldface letters (e.g., $\bX = (X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n)$, $\bx=(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$, resp.). 
%Here $n$ denotes the block length of communication. 
\\
The set of real numbers, non-negative real numbers and real vectors (of length $n$) are denoted by $\Real$, $\Real_+$, and $\Real^n$ respectively. 
\\
The set of natural numbers is denoted by $\Natural$. For $a\in\Natural$, let $[a]:=\{1,2,\cdots, a\}$. 
%Let $\bX^i=(X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_i)$ and $\bX_i^j=(x_i,X_{i+1},\cdots,X_{j})$ denote vectors. 
\\
We denote the Hamming distance between two vectors, say $\bx,\bx'\in\cX^n$ by $d_H(\bx,\bx')
=\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}_{\{x_i\neq x'_i\}}$, where $\mathbf{1}_{A}$  denotes the indicator of $A$.
%
\\
Let $\cP(\cX)$ denote the simplex of probability distributions on set $\cX$. Let $\cP(\cX|\cY)$ denote the set of all conditional probability distributions induced by random variable $X\in\cX$ conditioned on events generated by random variable $Y\in\cY$. 
\\
We denote by $P_X$, $P_{X|Y}$ and $P_{X,Y}$ the probability distribution of random variable $X\in\cX$, the conditional probability distribution induced by random variable $X\in\cX$ conditioned on  events generated by random variable $Y\in\cY$ and the joint probability distribution  on the pair of random variables $(X,Y)\in\cX\times \cY$ respectively.
\\ 
For the latter, we denote the marginal distribution on random variable $X$ by $[P_{X,Y}]_X$. Given $P_{X}$, $P_{X}^{(n)} := P_X ^{\tensor n}$ denotes the $n$-fold memoryless extension of $P_X$. 
Similarly $P_{X|Y}^{(n)}$, $P_{X,Y}^{(n)}$ denote the $n$-fold memoryless extension of $P_{X|Y}$ and $P_{X,Y}$ respectively. 
\\
We denote by $P_{X|Y=y} := P_{X|Y}(\cdot ,y)$ the conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y=y$.
\\
We denote by $W_{\bx} := W_{Y|X}^{(n)}(\cdot|\bx)$ the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=\bx$ in the $n$-fold memoryless extension of $W_{Y|X}$.
\\
Let $\Prob[A]$ denote the probability of event $A$. Deterministic and random functions will be denoted by lower case letters (eg. $f$) and by upper case letters (e.g., $F$) respectively. 
\\
Let $X \sim P_X$ denote that random variable $X$ is distributed according to probability distribution $P_X$.
\\
Let $X\sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$ denote a Bernoulli random variable $X$ with parameter $p\in[0,1]$. 
\\
Given $P_X,Q_X \in \cP(\cX)$, let $D(P_X||Q_X)$ denote the KL divergence between $P_X$ and $Q_{X}$ and let $\norm{P_{X}-Q_X}_1$ denote the $\ell_1$ distance between $P_X$ and $Q_{X}$.
%
\\
Given $P_X$ and $\delta>0$, let $\cT^{(n)}_{\delta}(P_X)=\{\bx: \left|T_{\bx}(x)-P_{X}(x)\right|\leq \delta, \ \forall x \in \mathcal{X}\}$ denote the set of typical $\bx$-sequences, where $T_{\bx}$ denotes the type of a sequence $\bx\in\cX^n$.
